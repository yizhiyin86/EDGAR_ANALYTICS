# EDGAR_ANALYTICS

I used python to write the script.
## Version Python 3.6.3 
I used the following libraries 
<li>csv</li>
<li>os</li>
<li>datetime</li>
All these are from the Python Standard Library so no additional installations are needed if you are using Python 3.6.

## Approach to solve the challenge
### Data Structure
* each user=['IP',request_counts for current time stamp,..,..] e.g. user=['IP_1',0,0,1] User IP 1 made 0, 0, 1 requests at time stamp starting_time+0,starting_time+1,starting_time+2
* all users are stored in a list users=[ ['IP',0,0,1], [..],[..] ]
### Process
